used to accounting matters

It's similar to this:
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM users WHERE salary_range = "1"; // result: 2

in this case, the database uses two consults, the GROUP BY is only one consult, it's best for the performance of the server

SELECT COUNT(*) as count, salary_range FROM users GROUP BY salary_range; //result:
	count 	salary_range
	5		1
	3		2
	1		3
	
when you use only the GROUP BY, the result is only the first values of each result GROUP. 
sample:
	SELECT * FROM users GROUP BY salary_range;
	id	salary_range	name	email	password	birth_date
