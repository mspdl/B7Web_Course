Class 02 - Installing the git.

There are two sites involving git: github and gitbucket.

Git is only the place where you find your repositories.

Official site of git: https://git-scm.com/

After access the site, clicking on downloads, you choose your system and get the file.

To check if the git is installed in your system, go to console and type:
	git --version
