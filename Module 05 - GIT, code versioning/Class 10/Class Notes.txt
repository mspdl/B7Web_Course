Class 10 - Connecting local repository to the remote repository

Configuring the acess between github and the local computer
	With the repository created on github, you'll need to get a key on your computer.
	on windows, it's necessary to download git bash (http://gitforwindows.org/)
	open git bash and type:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your email>"
	then, it'll ask you the name of the file to save the key 
	Just Press Enter
	then, it'll ask the password 
	Just Press Enter
	then, it'll ask the password again
	Just Press Enter
	Now you access the folder: C:/Users/<youruser>/.ssh/ (can accessed by using win+R)
	open the file id_rsa.pub and copy the entire content
	go back to your github profile page, click on your profile and select 'Settings'
	Now click in "SSH and GPG keys" on the left menu
	Now click in "New SSH keys", put a title and paste the code, copied in the id_rsa.pub file

Sending files to the github:
	https://github.com/<your profile link>/<your module>
	open the Git CMD and type:
		git remote add <destiny> https://github.com/<your profile link>/<your module>.git
		you can see more details typing git remote -v or just git remote to see what're sending
		git <function> -u <destiny> <branch>
		<function> can be:
			push: to push files to the remote server
			fetch: to download files from the remote server
		it'll ask your email and password of github, fill it and log into the github

	Now if you refresh your module page on github, you'll see your files, files that was only on your local computer
