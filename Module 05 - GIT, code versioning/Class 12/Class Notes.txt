Class 12 - Ignoring files in the repository (gitignore)

First you need to create a file inside your project called '.gitignore'
Inside the file '.gitignore', type the file or folder you want to ignore, in each line, like this:
	passwords.txt
	secret_folder/*
	db_backup.sql
	*.txt

Now when you press 'git status' the files in the '.gitignore' file will be ignored by the git.
