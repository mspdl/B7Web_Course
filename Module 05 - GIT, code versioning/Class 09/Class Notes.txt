Class 09 - Creating a directory on Github

Repositories on gi are only local. To send your respositories to the cloud, you'll need another service, like github or gitbucket.

On this course, we'll use github, so we need to acess the site:
	https://github.com/
	Sign in
	Create a new repository (https://github.com/new)
	Add the Repository name and the respository description
