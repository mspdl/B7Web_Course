What is it, what is it, how does it work?

It was raised because of some problems:
1 - the programmer could not return changes to his files/codes (to have a historical of changes in the code and easily find problems when the software stop to work and have a backup when a big bug appear.)

2 - incompatibility between projects involving the same code and multiple programmers at the same time
