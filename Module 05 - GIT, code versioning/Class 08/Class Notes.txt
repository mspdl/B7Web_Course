Class 08 - Difference between files

To see the changes in the files, before commit:
	git diff

To see only the name of the files changed, before commit:
	git diff --name-only

To revert changes that you don't want to commit:
	git checkout HEAD (this is the actual branch) -- <filename>
	example:
		git checkout HEAD style.css
