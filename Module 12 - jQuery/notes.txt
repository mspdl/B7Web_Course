jQuery has three versions to download:
1 - compressed: this version is recomended to use on the site, for it's smaller than the others. This version is difficult to interpret, therefore, is hard to learn
2 - uncompressed: this version is recomended to learn, for it's code is organized, being easy to learn.
3 - map file: only for who wants to develops with jQuery

jquery import is recommendo to put in body tag, not the head tag

to know which frameworks are installed on the page, use the frameworks extesion for google chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frameworks/jgghnecdoiloelcogfmgjgcacadpaejf

recommended to import your personal js after the jquery scripts

$.action = is an action from the jQuery itself
$(element).action = is an action in a specific element, can be of the jquery or not

$(document).ready(function(){}); // load the function() after load the site (document)
$(function(){}); // the same as the line above

// the same as the lines above:
$function allReady(){}
$(document).ready(allReady);

to avoid conflits is recommended to create a variable attributing the function jQuery.noConflict(); there is a sample in class 05

another way to avoid conflict is using the jQuery directly, like this:
jQuery(document).ready(function() {}); // the $ is changed to jQuery on call a function

to see how to select elements of HTML, see the class 06

to change an attribute of a tag element on console, we need use like this:
$('tag').attr('attribute','value');

to get the attribute:
$('tag').attr('attribute');

to change all content of a div or other tag with many tags inside it, use the property html:
$('tag').html('new text sample');

to show all content of a div or other tag with many tags inside it, use the property html empty:
$('tag').html();

to select an unique element of a tag with many tags inside it:
$('tag').find('tag_inside_tag');

to add a class in a element
$('tag').addClass('className');

to change a content of a tag inside a tag with many tags:
$('tag').find('tag_inside_tag').html('new content')
